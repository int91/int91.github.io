                <h2>What is the current Ogue release plan?</h2>
                <p>The current plan for Ogue is to release at 1.0 (Fully polished and playable version) or 0.8 (Expected fully playable version) at a 
                    maximum price of $3.99 USD with regional pricing for steam users. If possible, physical copies of Ogue will be released in the 
                    old-school style big boxes with a steam code and physical disc. Any future DLC releases will also have its own big box release. 
                    DLC is planned and I'm fully aware of what people think of DLC but this is not a money grab, each DLC will include massive content 
                    and story expansions with maybe some small features that don't paywall the fun, but add to the gameplay experience. I've carefully 
                    thought of the release plan and pricing over the course of a few months. Every DLC will release at $0.99 USD. DLC is planned to 
                    release twice a year though it's not a guarantee and I don't really like taking people's money, the only explanation for the release 
                    price is to make up living expenses for the time spent on development. </p>
                <p>Estimated release can be expected to be anywhere from 2025-2026. I'm a small developer with a full-time position in a very labor intensive job so 
                    this project is mainly just a hobby project, hence why I'm not going to take pre-orders or any money until the game is released. 
                    If physical releases become a thing then pre-orders will be available as the digital release will already be in the hands of everyone 
                    that wants it.</p>
                <h3>Release Platforms</h3>
                <p>Ogue is planned to release on the following platforms on release day. Ogue may be ported to more platforms after release.</p>
