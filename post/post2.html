                <h2>More About Ogue</h2>
                <p>Since Ogue is a Ui-driven game you'll mainly be interacting with buttons and clicking ui elements.
                    this creates a few design challenges. How do you make a game where all you do is click things fun?
                    That's the question I've had to answer many times over the nearly two years I've started and restarted development.
                    I know that's not very confidence inducing, but hear me out, the money is invested and majority of the game is well
                    thought out and planned. Two years of just designing a game in your head is quite a bit to keep up with, so what I've done is write 
                    down or type whatever thought I had in my head during work. I have massive discord logs about how features will work from getting
                    feedback from friends on those feature's designs. I have a massive list of features that are very doable even for a single man developer
                    such as myself. Though, I think we all still wish game development wasn't so time consuming and confusing at times. I don't have the UI/UX designed 
                    yet, but I've spent tons of time mostly writing code and prototyping features. The big feature I really like so far is the dungeon generation.
                    Multi-threaded dungeon generation allows massive dungeons with three-hundred or more rooms to be generated quickly. I had never actually used 
                    multi-threading before this project, but I've figured it out as I tinkered around with it a bit. I mainly have to multi-thread the generation 
                    to prevent a really back lock up that just wouldn't be fixed otherwise. This does make the whole game a little more complicated to write but it's 
                    really not as bad as I make it out to be. I'll do more testing with more threads to see what can be done to speed up generation even more.
                    I know this isn't really a "more about Ogue" conversation, though that is the title. This log is more of a "I don't have much to say at the moment 
                    so I'm just going to ramble on and on for hours," kind of log.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But anyways, thanks for reading this log and I hope to write more until the end of time.
                </p>
