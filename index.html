                <!-- This is where you place your landing page content! -->
                <p>Welcome to the offical website for Ogue, the UI-driven/Text-based, Rogue-lite, Dungeon crawling, Party-based, Turn-based, RPG.</p>
                <h3>What is Ogue?</h3>
                <p>Humanity in 3083 have managed to travel to different planets. Many planets have been explored, researched, and destroyed by the colonies that seek 
                    refuge away from their home planets that were being destroyed by over industrialization and poor environmental protection practices. One colony in 
                    particular stationed on the planet Ogue had discovered a peculiar phenomenon, the planet Ogue had large labyrinths that would seemingly appear and 
                    disappear at random. These labyrinths were studied endlessly. Turns out, these labyrinths emitted a signal that could be received by communication 
                    equipment the colonists used. They studied the signals and learned when each labyrinth would appear and when they would disappear. The labyrinths were 
                    later renamed to dungeons after they sent an armed crew into the labyrinths and discovered a large amount of hostile creatures, most of them resembling
                     humans. These crews were later named Dungeon Divers after labyrinths were found to be rather deep, often spanning ten to twenty floors deep. Every 
                     resource naturally found on Ogue were discovered to be created in these dungeons. The hostile creatures in these dungeons seemed to have similar 
                     equipment to the colonists, though some of their technology is almost of another age, the creatures had technology capable of mapping out an entire 
                     dungeon by simply entering a dungeon. Your goal on Ogue is to take Dungeon Dive contracts and uncover the secrets still hidden behind the dungeon 
                     spawning phenomenon while gathering materials and obtaining valuables.</p>
                <h3>How do you play Ogue?</h3>
                <p>You control your actions in Ogue by interacting with various UI elements or a text-console (OFF by default). The goal is to provide gameplay with similar depth to 
                    immersive sims like Deus Ex and Dwarf Fortress. Controller support is something that is high on the list of features along with an on-screen keyboard 
                    for users of any touch device or input method (Tablets, Mouse, Controller, etc.). (You can hotkey specific actions to buttons on a controller or 
                    keyboard). Future features would be to add customizable action buttons for Tablet & Controller users to make groups of actions easier to remember and 
                    use.</p>
                <h3>Development Log Schedule</h3>
                <p>I'm going to try to release an in-depth devlog every week to twice a week depending on how much work is done and how important each
                    feature is to the final build of Ogue.
